I want to improve the conditions around me right now. For that I consider what is in my actual power.
I will not be bitter or sarcastic but will see hardship as a challenge.
I will also accept that a lot of things can not be changed easily.
I am doing all of this not forgetting that everything is impermanent, even our species and universe. And that thus none
of what I do will have a permanent effect.
I will not use that as an excuse to waive my right to vote, to withold my duty to sign petitions or to not get involved with charities or my community.

## Transmission
I will Tell other people how they can make a difference and the positive effects will cascade around the globe.
This is why transmission is the most important item on this list. I am aware that my encouragment will only have 
an effect if I am non-intrusive.
